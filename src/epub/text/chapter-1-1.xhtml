			<p><span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span> was born on <time datetime="1839-09-02">September 2, 1839</time>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> in a little two story and attic brick house, yet standing in a good state of preservation, in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia, <abbr class="postal">PA</abbr></span>, on <span epub:type="z3998:place">Tenth Street</span>, south of Pine, not half a mile from the old State House where the Declaration of Independence was signed.</p>
			<p>His father’s blood was <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">English</span>, with a tradition of <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">Welsh</span>; his mother’s blood <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">English</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">Scottish</span>. In the main he came of middle-class stock. The only persons among his ancestors who achieved any distinction were his grandfathers; on his mother’s side, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">John Vallance</span>, a native of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Glasgow, Scotland</span>, who became an engraver of repute in this country in the early days of the republic and whose name may be seen on some of the commissions signed by <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">President</span> Washington; and on his father’s side, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Richard George</span>, born in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Yorkshire, England</span>, who was one of the well-known shipmasters of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span> when that city was the commercial metropolis of the new world.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Captain</span> George married <span epub:type="z3998:place">Mary Reid</span>, of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span>, and to them were born three children, the youngest of whom, Richard Samuel Henry, in <span epub:type="z3998:place">New Brunswick, New Jersey</span>, in <time>1798</time>. This <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Richard Samuel Henry George</span> became the father of <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span>, the subject of the present volume. In <time>1873</time>, on the day preceding his seventy-fifth natal anniversary, he wrote his son Henry a letter of reminiscences, of which the following serves to show the man and the early conditions in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span>:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“I have seen all the Presidents, from Washington down to the present, Grant⁠—that is, I cannot say I saw Washington, who died in <time datetime="1799-12-17">December, 1799</time>, but I think, although an infant, that I saw his sham funeral …</p>
				<p>“I go back to <time>1810</time>, during Jefferson’s long embargo. Then <span epub:type="z3998:place">Front Street, Philadelphia</span>, was what <span epub:type="z3998:place">Chestnut Street</span> is now⁠—the fashionable thoroughfare of the city. All the principal merchants lived on <span epub:type="z3998:place">Front Street</span> and on <span epub:type="z3998:place">Water Street</span> above South. Below South lived mostly sea captains, all hands to business.</p>
				<p>“Your grandfather had two ships, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Medora</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Burdo Packet</i>, and during the embargo and the war with <span epub:type="z3998:place">England</span> they were housed in; and from the navy yard down to the Point House, now called Greenwich, all the principal ships in port were housed in and hauled up on the mud, with noses touching the bank.</p>
				<p>“Although times were hard, I did not feel them. I had a pleasant, happy home, let me tell you. The first thing to be done was to provide for winter. Wood was burned for cooking and heating. Your grandfather would purchase a sloop-load of wood, so that I had a good time helping to throw it down cellar. We would have enough to last all winter and late into the spring. Then there was a supply of beef to corn and two or three hogs to cut up. That was a grand time! We had a smokehouse at one corner of the yard, and when father had cut up the hogs we would have a number of hams to smoke and cure. I do not taste such now, nor ever will again. At hog time mother made all sorts of good things⁠—scrapel, sausage and all that hog could do for man. And didn’t I go in for it all with the rest of the boys, for father had four ‘prenticed boys and two girls in the kitchen, all in good tune and happy. We had all sorts of songs and wonderful stories, both of the sea and of the land.</p>
				<p>“It was at this time (I am sorry I have no dates) that my father arrived at Almond Street wharf from <span epub:type="z3998:place">France</span>, to which he had gone with a flag of truce, carrying out a lot of passengers and bringing back a lot. Well, it was Sunday morning, about light, when I was waked up by mother. I asked what was the matter. She said that pop had arrived and that he had on board of the ship <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">General</span> Moreau and family from <span epub:type="z3998:place">France</span>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a> and she wanted to get some fresh provisions for their breakfast. So I took on board lots of things⁠—nice fresh milk and cream, butter, nice bread, chickens, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—for the general and his family. I tell you it was hard work getting on board, the crowd was so dense. On <span epub:type="z3998:place">Almond Street</span> from Second clear down to the wharf was a line of private carriages with invitations of hospitality. The boys crowded me hard, and one or two fellows I had to fight before I could pass.</p>
				<p>“Going so often to the ship, I found I was as much noticed as the general himself. It gave me a big lift among the downtown-gang. I was made captain of a company and had to fight the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Mead Alley</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:place">Catherine Street</span> boys every Saturday afternoon. Many bricks I got on the head while leading my men (or boys) into battle …</p>
				<p>“One fight I had built me right up, and afterwards I was A <abbr>No.</abbr> 1 among the boys, and cock of the walk. I went on the principle of <em>do nothing that you are ashamed of and let no living man impose on you</em>.</p>
				<p>“In my youth I could swim like a duck and skate well. And I was considered a good sailor. I could handle a boat equal to anybody. I got a good amount of praise, both on the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Delaware</span> and the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Mississippi</span>, for my seamanship. I could go aloft as quick and as handy as any seaman. Going to <span epub:type="z3998:place">New Orleans</span>, I often lent a hand on topsails, and could do as well as most of them.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><abbr class="name">R. S. H.</abbr> George made this trip to <span epub:type="z3998:place">New Orleans</span> when a young man, and there engaged in the dry goods business. Returning to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span>, he settled down and married Miss <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Louisa Lewis</span>, by whom he had two children, one of whom died while an infant, and the other, <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Richard</span>, while at boarding school in his twelfth year.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> Within four or five years after marriage this wife died, and several years later <abbr class="name">R. S. H.</abbr> George married another <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span> lady, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Catherine Pratt Vallance</span>. As has been said, her father was <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">John Vallance</span>, the engraver, born in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Glasgow, Scotland</span>. Her mother was <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Margaret Pratt</span>, born in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span>, but of <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">English</span> extraction. <span epub:type="z3998:place">John Vallance</span> died in <time>1823</time> leaving his widow, seven daughters and one son in modest means, which <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry Pratt</span>, a wealthy merchant of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span> and first cousin of the widow’s father, improved by giving to each of the seven girls a small brick house. These girls received a good boarding school education, and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Catherine</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Mary</span> were conducting a small private school when <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Catherine</span> was married to <abbr class="name">R. S. H.</abbr> George, who then had a book publishing business.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> George had for several years occupied a good clerical position in the Philadelphia Custom House, and left it in <time>1831</time> to enter a book publishing partnership with <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Thomas Latimer</span>, who had married <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Rebecca</span>, the eldest of the Vallance girls. The business was confined to the publication and sale of <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Protestant Episcopal Church</span> and Sunday School books, and for a time became the depository of the <span epub:type="z3998:organization">General Episcopal Sunday School Union</span>, the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Bible and Prayer Book Society</span> and the <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Tract Society</span>. After two and a half years <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Thomas Latimer</span> withdrew and others were associated successively in the business, which for seventeen years <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Richard George</span> carried on, the store for a time being at the north-west corner of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Chestnut and Fifth Streets</span>. A contemporary in the business was <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">George <abbr class="name">S.</abbr> Appleton</span>, who afterwards went to <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York</span> and merged with his brother in a general book publishing and book selling business, under the firm name of <span epub:type="z3998:organization">D. Appleton &amp; <abbr>Co.</abbr></span>⁠—the same <span epub:type="z3998:organization">D. Appleton &amp; <abbr>Co.</abbr></span> who, several decades later, were to be the first publishers of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Progress and Poverty</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> By <time>1848</time> the business of the general book houses had encroached so much on denominational business that the latter became unprofitable, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">George</span> withdrew and went back to the Custom House, obtaining the position of Ascertaining Clerk, which he thereafter held for nearly fourteen years.</p>
			<p>To the union of <abbr class="name">R. S. H.</abbr> George and <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Catharine Pratt Vallance</span> ten children were born, six girls⁠—Caroline, Jane, Catharine, Chloe, Mary and Rebecca, the last two of whom died early⁠—and four boys⁠—Henry, Thomas, John and Morris⁠—the second child and oldest boy being the subject of this work. Like the son by the former marriage, this boy was named after his father; but as the former bore the name of Richard, the first of the father’s three Christian names⁠—Richard Samuel Henry⁠—the last of the names was selected for this son; and as the father desired a short name, complaining of the annoyance to himself of a long one, the simple one of Henry George was chosen.</p>
			<p>Henry George’s father was a strict churchman. He was a vestryman at <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul’s Episcopal Church, when that church, under the earnest preaching of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Richard Newton</span>, was at the height of its prosperity. The congregation was of the extreme “Low Church” division and regarded “High Church” tendencies with the utmost abhorrence. Sunday was a day for austere devotions⁠—church services morning and afternoon, and frequently in the evening. On other days there were morning and evening family prayers. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rt.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Ignatius <abbr class="name">F.</abbr> Horstmann</span>, Catholic Bishop of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Cleveland, <abbr class="postal">OH</abbr></span>, who was a boy in the neighbourhood at the time, has said:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> “I can recall Henry George going to church every Sunday, walking between his two elder sisters, followed by his father and mother⁠—all of them so neat, trim and reserved.”</p>
			<p>But that there were occasional breaks in the austerity may be certain. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">George <abbr class="name">A.</abbr> Latimer</span>, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span>’s cousin, has said:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Henry George was in my Sunday school class. It was the custom of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Newton to have the children of the church in the main lecture room once a month in the afternoon for catechising. One Sunday the subject was that part of the catechism that declares our duty towards our neighbour, and the special topic, ‘to keep my hands from picking and stealing.’ Our class was on the front row. The Doctor asked the question: ‘Boys, why do the grocerymen have that wire netting over the dried peaches in the barrel at the store door?’ Henry George at once answered with a loud voice: ‘To keep the flies out.’ The Doctor’s face turned as red as blood, while at the same time he said: ‘Yes, to keep the hands from picking and stealing.’ ”</p>

			<p><abbr>Rev.</abbr> William Wilberforce Newton, son of the rector, who was in this school with Henry George, said in an address after the latter’s death that “that school turned out some remarkable men,” naming Bishop Charles R. Hall of Illinois, Bishop Wm. H. Odenheimer of New Jersey, <abbr>Rev.</abbr> Wm. W. Farr, Henry S. Getz, <abbr>Rev.</abbr> Richard N. Thomas, editor of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">American Church Sunday School Magazine</i>, George C. Thomas, of Drexel &amp; <abbr>Co.</abbr> bankers, and Treasurer of the Missionary Society of the <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Protestant Episcopal Church</span>, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">R. Heber Newton</span>, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">William Wilberforce Newton</span>’s brother. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Newton told this anecdote:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Our class was located in that part of the church known as the basement, and as we looked out at the window, our view was obstructed by innumerable grave stones.</p>
				<p>“My people were extremely hospitable to missionaries. One time Missionary Bishop Payne of Africa came with his wife to our house and staid six weeks. They brought with them a lot of monkeys and other beasts of the tropical clime. We used to have great times among ourselves⁠—the boys of the neighbourhood and the monkeys and the dumb animals⁠—playing ‘firemen.’ One day we were having a parade. There was no flag. So I went into the house and got a Sunday school banner with an illustration of Paul preaching at Ephesus. It was not exactly appropriate, but it answered the purpose. Henry George insisted upon carrying the banner which all the boys thought a good deal of.</p>
				<p>“As our firemen’s parade was turning the corner of the house that day, Henry George heard my father say to the missionary that if he saw anything about the house that he thought would be of service to him in Africa he was welcome to it, and the missionary replied that he thought the tool chest would come in handy. George passed the word along the line and very soon our parade was broken up and we became an army of warriors for the protection of that tool chest. But it went to Africa just the same.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>At the time of his son Henry’s birth, the book business enabled <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George to keep his family in comfort. Giving care to his children’s education, he sent them as they grew old enough to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Graham’s private school, on Catharine Street near Third, the family having moved from Tenth Street to the west side of Third Street, three doors north of Queen, where they remained for nearly twenty-five years. After three years at <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Graham’s, and when he was in his ninth year, the eldest son, Henry, was sent to a public school, <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Mount Vernon Grammar</span>, where <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Ignatius Horstmann</span> attended in a class above him. A year later, in <time>1849</time>, he was sent to the <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Episcopal Academy</span>.</p>
			<p>This institution, flourishing to-day, was founded in revolutionary times, but seemed to decline until <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Bishop</span> <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Alonzo Potter</span> raised it at the end of the forties to first rank as a place of instruction in the city and State. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hare was then principal, and the institution was frequently spoken of as Hare’s Academy. The Bishop’s two sons, Henry <abbr class="name">C.</abbr> and <abbr class="name">E. N.</abbr> Potter were at the Academy then, and in the years to come were to achieve distinction, the former as the Episcopal Bishop of <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York City</span> and the other as president of two colleges successively. <abbr class="name">R.</abbr> Heber Newton and William Wilberforce Newton were also fellow students. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Heber Newton remembers the school as being in a most prosperous condition, “the large chapel being quite filled with boys, and the class rooms seemingly well filled, and attendance upon it was esteemed an advantage and a privilege.”</p>
			<p>But though it was a good school, young George did not stay there long. His father had now ceased to be publisher of Church books, yet he obtained for his son the reduced rate of tuition granted to clergymen’s sons. This concession was regarded by the boy as something to which he was not entitled and he believed that every boy in the school knew of it; and perhaps it was for this reason that from the start he did not get along well there. At any rate, his father, yielding to his entreaties, took him away and put him in the hands of <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry <abbr class="name">Y.</abbr> Lauderbach</span> to be prepared for High school. This short period, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span> always recognised as the most profitable portion of his little schooling. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lauderbach had a way of his own, drawing out and stimulating the individuality of his pupils. Thirty years afterwards he clearly remembered <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span> as a student remarkable among boys for quickness of thought, originality and general information. The special training under Lauderbach enabled the youth at little more than thirteen to enter a class in the High school that was to produce some notable men in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Pennsylvania</span>⁠—<span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Theodore Cramp</span>, ship builder; <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Charles <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Alexander</span>, journalist; <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">James Morgan Hart</span>, professor and author; <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Samuel <abbr class="name">L.</abbr> Gracey</span>, Methodist Episcopal clergyman; <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">David <abbr class="name">H.</abbr> Lane</span>, a Recorder of Philadelphia; and <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">William Jenks Fell</span>, Commissioner of Deeds. This school, like the <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Episcopal Academy</span>, was an excellent one, but later in life <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span> said that while there he was “for the most part idle and wasted time.” Perhaps it was that he had his mind’s eye set on the world outside of school! Perhaps it was that conscious that the growing family was putting a strain on his father, whose sole income was the $800 salary of a Custom House clerk, he felt that he should be supporting himself. It was probably his Uncle <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Thomas Latimer</span> who at this time gave him advice of which he spoke in a speech about thirty years later: “I remember when a boy, I wanted to go to sea. I talked with a gentleman, who wanted me to go into business as a boy in a store. I had nothing, no particular facility, yet I remember his saying to me: ‘If you are honest, if you are steady, if you are industrious, you can certainly look forward to being able to retire at forty with comfort for the rest of your days.’ ”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> These words may have had a strong influence on the boy’s mind. At any rate, after less than five months in the High School, he induced his father to take him away, to stop his schooling altogether, and put him to work; and he never went to school afterwards. He was then less than fourteen years old.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> He first obtained employment in the china and glass importing house of <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Samuel Asbury &amp; <abbr>Co.</abbr></span>, at <span epub:type="z3998:place">85 South Front Street</span>, at $2 a week. His duties were to copy, to tie up bundles and to run errands. Afterwards he went into the office of a marine adjuster and did clerical work.</p>
			<p>But though he had left school for good, his real education suffered no interruption. In school or out of it, he had acquired a fondness for reading. Or perhaps it was that at his birth, while the Fairies of Gain, Fashion and Pleasure passed him by, one came and sat beside his cradle and softly sang:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>Mine is the world of thought, the world of dream;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine all the past, and all the future mine.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>First he had a grounding in the Bible; and the Puritanical familiarity with book, chapter and verse, which in the elders moulded speech, established habit, and guided the steps of life, filled the young mind with a myriad of living pictures. Then, though his father while a publisher handled only religious books, and those confined to the Episcopal Church, there were the strange tales of missionaries in foreign lands to feed the imagination. Afterwards when the father left the book business there was still an atmosphere of reading about the home, and other books came in the boy’s way. He delighted in history, travels and adventure, fiction and poetry. While in his strong democratic principles and practical side, the boy followed his father, it was in a love of poetry that he resembled his mother, who as an elderly woman could quote verse after verse and poem after poem learned in her girlhood. She manifested at all times an intense fondness for Scott, and had a taste for Shakespeare, though owing to her austere principles, she never in her life attended a Shakesperian play.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> This religious ban extended in the boy’s reading to much in the realm of romance and adventure, such works as the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Scottish Chiefs</i>, for instance, having to be read in the seclusion of his attic bed chamber. But in the open or in the smuggled way books were obtained, and the old Quaker Apprentice’s Library and the Franklin Institute Library furnished inexhaustible mines of reading matter. Book after book was devoured with a delight that showed that now certainly the youthful mind was not “idle” nor his “time wasted.” He absorbed information as the parched earth a summer shower, and what he thus took in he retained. To this fondness for reading he always ascribed the beginning of his real education and the commencement of his career.</p>
			<p>And what came like enchantment to his mind and supplemented his reading were popular scientific lectures at the <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Franklin Institute</span>. This institution, named after the famous townsman, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Benjamin Franklin</span>, and incorporated in <time>1824</time> for “the promotion and encouragement of manufactures and the mechanic and useful arts,” in the forties and fifties took first rank in scientific learning in the city, which at the same time was without peer in this country for its public libraries, museums and private cabinets. Of the Institute, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span>’s uncle, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Thomas Latimer</span>, was a member. To him the boy was indebted for access to the lectures⁠—lectures that revealed the wonders of the physical sciences in simple language and magic lantern pictures. Like a torch they lit up the young understanding and made a fitting attendant to that university of reading to which he was of his own volition applying himself.</p>
			<p>This reading fed a desire that his father’s stories and the tales and traditions about his grandfather had kindled in him for the sea. “One of our chief playgrounds,” <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr class="name">W. W.</abbr> Newton has said, “was about the wharves of the city. He had a friend who was a sea captain and I a cousin, and both of us had our minds set on a sea voyage.” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> George encouraged in his son an active life, going to see him skate and swim. One day he saved him from drowning by putting down his cane when the boy had dived under a float. Though a strict churchman, the father could not forget his own early warlike days and was not averse to having his boy fight in just quarrels. But it was the shipping that chiefly interested father and son, and as they strolled along the river-piers together, the father talked about hull and rig, wind and weather, and the wonders of sea and foreign lands, so that the wharves had a fascination for the boy, and it was around them that with <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Willie Newton</span> or <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Bill Horner</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Col</span> and <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Charley Walton</span> and <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Will Jones</span> he spent much of his play time, climbing about vessels, going swimming or sailing toy boats. And this was not all idle play, but served its purposes in later life, for the boy’s powers of observation and reasoning were in constant exercise.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></p>

			<p>After a while, when the boy left the crockery house and went into the marine adjuster’s office, the desire for the sea increased so much that he went to his cousin, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">George Latimer</span>, who was ten years older than himself, and asked him to speak in his behalf to an acquaintance of the family, a young man named <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Samuel Miller</span> who was mate and whose father was captain of the ship <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i>. No better insight into the habits of the boy and of his constant thought of the sea can be obtained than from extracts from a short journal that he kept at the beginning of <time>1855</time>, probably at the suggestion of his uncle, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Thomas Latimer</span>. Though then scarcely more than fifteen, and although he had spent all his life in a town of brick houses and perhaps had never more than seen the ocean, he noted wind and weather with the care of a veteran sea captain. Incidentally the journal shows the important part the lectures at the <span epub:type="z3998:organization">Franklin Institute</span> were playing:</p>

			<p>Young <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Samuel <abbr class="name">W.</abbr> Miller</span>, then about twenty-five, had obtained command of the ship <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i>, an old East Indiaman, on which he had formerly sailed as mate under his father, who was now transferred to a new ship. At the suggestion of <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">George Latimer</span>, and after talking with <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span>’s father, he had formally invited young <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Henry</span> to sail with him. For <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Richard George</span> was a clear headed, common-sensed man. Much as he disliked to have the boy go to sea, he knew that his son inherited the longing. Moreover, knowing the strong, wilful nature of his son, he feared that if objection was raised the boy might run away, as he had done once before while yet going to school. The lad had made an impertinent reply to his mother, and his father, overhearing it, reproved him with words and a blow. To be struck by his father was so unusual that he was humiliated. He stole away, got his school books and a little cold lunch⁠—all that he could get to eat⁠—and left the house with the resolve never to return again. He remained out until half past nine o’clock that night, when he returned with a tamer spirit and was forgiven. The father had not forgotten this incident, and he was determined that if the boy must go to sea he should go with his parents’ consent. So he talked to <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Captain</span> Miller and suggested to him not to make the boy’s berth too comfortable, but to let him see and feel the rigours of a sailor’s life, so that by a single voyage the desire for roving should be destroyed. <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span> was then accepted as foremast boy on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i>, bound for <span epub:type="z3998:place">Melbourne, Australia</span>, and <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta, India</span>.</p>

				<p><span epub:type="z3998:place">Australia</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:place">India</span> swam in the boy’s fancy as in a shining sea of gold. <span epub:type="z3998:place">Australia</span>, the island continent nearly as large as the <span epub:type="z3998:place">United States</span>, giving promise of a great rival, <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">English</span>-speaking republic in the southern hemisphere, had riveted attention by its gold discoveries in the early fifties and by the enormous treasure since taken out⁠—equal almost to that of wonderful <span epub:type="z3998:place">California</span>. It was the new land of wealth, where poor, obscure men in a day rose to riches. <span epub:type="z3998:place">India</span> lay like a counterpoise in the mind’s picture. With her jungles and monkeys, tigers and elephants; her painted idols, fantastical philosophies and poppy smokers⁠—this land of mysteries, old when the pyramids of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Egypt</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:place">Syria</span> were young, shone through partings in her gorgeous tropical foliage with the gleam of gold and precious stones, despite the pillage of the ages. Whatever the boy had read, from <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Bible</span> to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Arabian Nights</i>, in magazine or in newspaper; and all that he had heard, in lecture or sermon, from traveller or sailor, burned in his imagination and made him eager to be gone.</p>
				<p>The <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i> was to sail from <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York Harbour</span> early in <time>April</time>. On <time datetime="1855-04-01">Sunday, April 1</time>, after Sunday school, <span epub:type="z3998:place">Henry George</span> received a <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Bible</span> and a copy of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">James’s Anxious Enquirer</i>; and the next morning, bidding farewell at the wharf to his father, and uncles <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Thomas Latimer</span> and <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Joseph Van Dusen</span>, his cousin <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">George Latimer</span> and his friends <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Col Walton</span> and <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Joe Roberts</span>, he and <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Captain</span> Miller went aboard the steamboat, crossed the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Delaware</span>, took train, and four hours afterwards were in <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York</span>. Two letters from him, written from the ship before she got away, have been preserved. They are in large, clear, firm hand, with some shading, some flourishes and a number of misspelled words. In the first, under date of <time datetime="1855-04-06">April 6</time>, he says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
					<p>“I signed the shipping articles at $6 a month and two months’ advance, which I got in the morning.</p>
					<p>“While we were down town we stopped at the Custom House, and <span epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jim</span> [an ordinary seaman] and I got a protection, for which we paid $1 each to a broker.</p>
					<p>“The <span epub:type="z3998:organization">New York Custom House</span> looks like a cooped up affair along side of the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span> one⁠—there are so many people and so much business and bustle.</p>
					<p>“The upper part of <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York</span> is a beautiful place⁠—the streets wide, clear and regular; the houses all a brown stone and standing ten or twenty feet from the pavement, with gardens in front.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>To the foregoing letter was added this:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">

					<p>“I was stopped [writing] suddenly last night by the entrance of the men to haul her [the vessel] to the end of the wharf and was prevented from going on by their laughing and talking. At about twelve o’clock we commenced and by some pretty hard heaving we got her to the end of the wharf. It was then about two o’clock. So we turned in and slept until about half past five. We got our breakfast, and being taken in tow by a steamboat about 7:30 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr>, proceeded down the stream till off the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Battery</span>, where we dropped anchor and now lie.</p>
					<p>“The view from this spot is beautiful⁠—the <span epub:type="z3998:place">North River</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York Bay</span> covered with sailing vessels and steamers of every class and size, while back, the hills, gently sloping, are covered with country seats. …</p>
					<p>“I ate my first meals sailor style to-day and did not dislike it at all. Working around in the open air gives one such an appetite that he can eat almost anything. We shall go to sea <time datetime="1855-04-09">Monday</time> morning early. I should love to see you all again before I go, but that is impossible. I shall write again to-morrow, and if possible get the pilot to take a letter when he leaves, though it is doubtful that I shall be able to write one.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>It was in these days preparatory to starting, when there were a lot of odd things to do, that the boatswain, busy with some splicing, sent the boy for some tar; and when the boy stopped to look around for a stick, the sailor in surprise and disgust cried to him to bring the tar in his hand! Another incident of a similar kind appears in his second letter, which is dated <time datetime="1855-04-09">April 9</time> and is addressed to his Aunt <span epub:type="z3998:given-name">Mary</span>, one of his mother’s sisters, a most unselfish and lovable maiden lady who helped raise the large brood of <span epub:type="z3998:family-name">George</span> children, and who, until her death in <time>1875</time>, had never been separated from her sister, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:family-name">George</span>. She was loved as a second mother by the children.</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
					<p>“We are not at sea, as we expected to be by this time, but still lying off the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Battery</span>. The ship could not sail this morning for want of seamen. They are very scarce in <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York</span> now and all sorts of men are shipping as sailors. Two <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">Dutch</span> boys shipped as able sea men and came on board yesterday afternoon. The smallest one had been to sea before, but the largest did not know the difference between a yard and a block.</p>
					<p>The second mate told them to go aloft and slush down the masts. This morning the smallest went up, but the other could not go up at all. So I had to go aloft and do it. The work was a good deal easier than I expected. I don’t mind handling grease at all now.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></p>

He says he has four trades⁠—baker, shoemaker, etc. An other man came aboard this morning as able seaman who could not get into the foretop. They sent him ashore. The captain shipped to-day as ordinary sea men two lads, one a <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">Spaniard</span> and the other <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">English</span>, I believe.

				<p>So it was that the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i>, a full-rigged ship of 586 tons register⁠—a very large ship at that time<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a>⁠—with 500,000 feet of lumber aboard and a crew of twenty men, all told, started on her long voyage; and as she glided down the bay and through the “Narrows” on her way to the ocean, on the left bank, eighty feet above the water, stood an old white house that forty years later, when his fame had spread through the world, was to become Henry George’s home and witness the end of his career. But the boy, all unconscious of this, had been set to work, as he says in his sea journal, “in company with the other boys to picking oakum for the carpenter, who was busy fastening and calking the hatches.”</p>
				<p>This journal or log, covers most of the voyage, and with the few letters that still exist, and an account of the passage written by <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Captain</span> Miller for his friend, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">George Latimer</span>, furnishes pretty full and clear information as to this important formative period. The journal consists of an original in two parts and three incomplete fair copies. The original parts are quite rough and show marks of wear and stains of water. One is of white, the other of blue, unruled, large sized letter paper, folded so as to make neat pages of four by six inches, and stitched together with heavy linen thread, such as might have been used in sewing sails. The entries are mostly in pencil, the spelling not of the best, and the writing not uniform⁠—in some places quite faint⁠—but generally small, condensed, round and clear. The fair copies are in a fine state of preservation. They are written in large, bold hand in commercial blank books and the spelling is correct. Two of them may have been copied while at sea, but the fullest and best looking one was doubtless written in Philadelphia after the voyage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></p>

				<p>From Captain Miller’s account it appears that when the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hindoo</i> cast off the tug that was taking her to sea, the wind was from the south-east and right ahead, and the pilot advised him to anchor at Sandy Hook; “but,” says the Captain, “we could not wait. We set all sail and stood <abbr class="compass">E. N. E.</abbr> until we saw the rocks of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Long Island</span>. We then tacked to the south’d and stood down until we were abreast the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Capes of Delaware</span>. Then a gale of wind from the north-west commenced, lasting four days; during which time we made good progress off the coast.” The boy’s log for these four days runs as follows:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary">
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-04-10"><abbr>Tues.</abbr> 10.</time> … About 12 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> we passed <span epub:type="z3998:place">Sandy Hook</span>, and a slight breeze springing up, set all fore and aft sail. About 3 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> discharged the tow boat and pilot. Soon after I began to feel sea-sick, and the breeze dying away, the tossing of the vessel very much increased it. … After supper all hands were called aft and the watches chosen. I was taken by the mate for the larboard … It being the larboard watch’s first watch below, I turned in at 8 <abbr class="time eoc">p.m.</abbr></p>
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-04-11"><abbr>Wed.</abbr> 11</time>. I was roused out of a sound sleep at 12 o’clock to come on deck and keep my watch. On turning out I found a great change in the weather. The wind had shifted to <abbr class="compass">N. W.</abbr> and came out cold and fierce. The ship was running dead before it in a <abbr class="compass">S. E.</abbr> direction, making about 8 or 9 knots an hour. After keeping a cold and dreary watch until 4 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> we were relieved and I was enabled to turn in again. All this day sea-sick by spells. … It will be a long time before we are in this part of the world again, homeward bound. Twelve months seem as if they would never pass. In the afternoon all hands were engaged in getting the anchors on the forecastle and securing them for a long passage. The colour of the sea is green on sounding, the shade varying according to the depth of water, and a beautiful blue outside, and so very clear that objects can be seen at a great depth.</p>
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-04-12"><abbr>Thurs.</abbr> 12</time>. A brisk breeze all day from <abbr class="compass">N. W.</abbr> with frequent showers of rain. Numbers of Stormy Petrels or Mother Carey’s Chickens hovering about the quarter. Weather rather cool.</p>
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-04-13"><abbr>Fri.</abbr> 13</time>. A fine bright day; wind still the same. Hoisting the lower stun’sail in the forenoon, the halyards parted, and the sail was with difficulty secured. The sea-sickness has now entirely left me.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The old ship after twenty-five years of hard service was pretty nearly worn out, and the log reveals a series of breakages, and some consequent accidents.</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary">
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-04-14"><abbr>Sat.</abbr> 14</time>. Commenced with fine clear weather and brisk breeze from <abbr class="compass eoc">N. W.</abbr> About 5:30 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr>, the larboard watch being on deck, the tiller of the rudder suddenly broke in half. All hands were immediately called and everything let go and clewed up. Tackles were got on the rudder and the ship steered by them, while the carpenter immediately set to work on a new one. While furling the main top-gallant sail a man belonging to the larboard watch, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">John Prentz</span> by name, fell from the yard to the deck. Luckily the main topsail, which was clewed up, broke his fall, or he would certainly have been killed. On taking him forward, his arm was found to have been broken in three places, but otherwise he had sustained no serious injury. His arm was set and bandaged by the mate. The carpenter finished the tiller about 4 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr>, when, everything being replaced, sail was again made on the ship and she continued on her course with a fair, though light wind. The old tiller which had suddenly broken, and which outwardly appeared so firm and sound, was in the centre completely rotted away. … The account which the man who fell from aloft gave of his mishap when he had recovered his senses was that he was pulling on the gasket with both hands when it suddenly parted and he was precipitated backwards. He knew no more until he found himself in the forecastle with his arm bandaged up.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The <time datetime="1855-04-15">fifteenth of April</time> is noted in the log as the “first Sunday at sea,” and that instead of being seated in <span epub:type="z3998:place">St. Paul’s Church</span>, they were “ploughing the ocean a thousand miles away.” Soon the entries take more of the formal aspect of a ship’s log and less of a personal journal, though once in a while they relax into general observation and fancy. On <time datetime="1855-05-03">May 3</time>, for instance, the ship, lying in a dead calm, was surrounded by a large school of dolphins, which presented “a most beautiful appearance in the water, changing to brilliant colours as they swam from place to place.” On <time datetime="1855-05-24">May 24</time> calms and light airs, with this entry:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary">
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“At 8:30 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> the mate succeeded in striking one of the porpoises which were playing under the bows. The fish was immediately run up to the bowsprit end by all hands, when a running bowline was put around his tail and he was hauled inboard, where he was soon despatched and dissected. We had a sort of hash of his flesh for supper, which was very palatable, and the rest was hung up to the topsail sheets, where it spoiled in the moonlight.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Thoughts kept reverting to home, and there is more than one entry like: “Would have given anything to have been back to breakfast.” Then came the <time datetime="1855-07-04">Fourth of July</time>:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary">
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-07-04">Wed. July 4</time>.

As soon as the smoke cleared away and the dead and wounded were mustered, it was found that it had not been without execution, all the glass on one side of the house being shattered (a loss not easily repaired) a port blown out; and the waddings (made of rope yarn, and very hard) had passed, one through the head of the new water cask, and another through the new foretopsail, which had not been bent a week. The wind, which had been strong from aft the day before, during the middle watch died away and was succeeded by a calm until 8 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr>, when a stiff breeze from the South sprang up, accompanied by showers of rain. At 12 <abbr class="time">m.</abbr> all hands were called to reef. While reefing the foretopsail the parrel of the yard gave way, causing a great deal of trouble and keeping all hands from dinner. It was 2:30 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> before our watch got below to their plum-duff, which had been allowed in honour of the day. The rest of the day was rainy, with wind constantly varying, keeping us hauling on the braces. Thus closed the most miserable <time datetime="1855-07-04">4th of July</time> that I have ever yet spent.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>On the ninety-seventh day out the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i> passed the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Cape of Good Hope</span>, though far to the south of it, and entered the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Indian Ocean</span>. Thence to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Port Philip (Melbourne)</span> came a succession of gales from the westward, with heavy squalls of hail and rain, but the ship driving before them made good progress.</p>

				<p>At last, on the one hundred and thirty-seventh day out from <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York</span>, the first land of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Australia</span> was sighted, and with that flamed up the desire of the crew to get ashore and strike out straight for the gold districts, where men with little more equipment than pick and pan were, so far as the sailors’ knowledge went, still washing fortunes out of the soil.</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary">
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-08-24"><abbr>Fri.</abbr> <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 24.</time> Commenced with strong wind from <abbr class="compass eoc">N.</abbr> Furled jib.

While reefing the main topsail we were agreeably surprised by the joyful sound of ‘Land ho!’ from the second mate, who was at the weather earing. ‘Where away?’ shouted the captain. ‘Right ahead,’ was the reply; and sure enough there lay the long looked for land directly before us, looming above the horizon like a dark blue cloud, the first solid ground we had looked upon for 137 days. By the time we [the larboard watch] turned out, 12 noon, we were about 2 miles distant, running along the land. Our captain had hit the exact spot, <span epub:type="z3998:place">Cape Otway</span>, the light house on which was now plainly to be seen. After dinner all hands turned to get the anchors over the bows. It was a beautiful afternoon. The clouds, which in the morning had obscured the sun, had now vanished. The ship was sailing smoothly along before the wind at the rate of 4 or 5 knots. Numerous birds, a species of Albatross, were flying around us, now and then darting down after a fish. The land was high and apparently thickly wooded, and although winter in this part of the world, presented a beautiful, green appearance. It was looked upon by most of the crew as the Land of Promise, where gold was to be had by all; and most of the men were engaged in laying out what they would do, and where they would go, and how they would spend their money when they got it. While getting the anchors over, one of the small coasters which we had seen in the morning passed our bows under a press of sail, and stood in closer to the land. At 6 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> we furled the mizzen topsail, and at 8 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> backed the main topsail and laid to all night.”</p>

				<p>Next day they took a pilot and at 3 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> cast anchor in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Hobson’s Bay</span>, opposite the Light house. Several American ships, some that had sailed before and some after the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i>, were also at anchor there.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a> Times were reported to be “very hard ashore, thousands with nothing to do and nothing to eat.” Notwithstanding this, the crew wished at once to get away.</p>

The mate told <span epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jim</span> and me to keep watch in the cabin until 12 and then call him.

				<p>For several days the men refused to work, demanding to see the <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">American</span> <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Consul</span>, and on <time datetime="1855-08-29">Wednesday</time>, four days after casting anchor, the captain got the <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Consul</span> aboard. The <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Consul</span> “took his seat on the booby hatch with the shipping articles before him,” and called up the crew one by one. He finally “told the men that, as the passage would not be up until the cargo was discharged, he could do nothing until that time; but that <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">Dutch</span> <span epub:type="z3998:given-name">John</span> (the man who in the early part of the passage fell from the main topgallant yard) was entitled to his discharge if he wished it.” The captain then promised that if they would “remain by the ship until she was discharged, he would pay them their wages and let them go in peace.” They demanded this in writing, saying that he might change his mind, “but the captain refused to give them any further guarantee than his word.” As they still desisted from work on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i>, they were taken off in a police boat, and sentenced to one month’s hard labour in the prison ship, at the end of which time, still refusing to work, they would perhaps have been sentenced to further imprisonment if the captain had not reached court too late to appear against them. Before he sailed, the captain had to ship a new crew.</p>
				<p>There is nothing in the journal to indicate that the boy thought <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Captain</span> Miller unjust, but the incident made an indelible impression, revealing the tremendous powers for tyranny the navigation laws put into the hands of a captain, and this was to inspire a remarkable fight for sailor’s rights in years to come.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></p>
				<p>The ship lay in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Hobson’s Bay</span> twenty-nine days discharging charge and taking in ballast. <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Captain</span> Miller in his account says: “Henry went up to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Melbourne</span> once, but did not see much to admire.” Perhaps the boy saw more than the captain realised, for thirty-five years later, in a speech in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Melbourne</span>, he said, that he had a vivid recollection of it⁠—“its busy streets, its seemingly continuous auctions, its crowds of men with flannel shirts and long thigh boots, its bay crowded with ships.” No letters written from there now exist, but it is clear that the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Australia</span> of his dreams did not appear to be such a wonderful place after all; that there was not much gold in sight and that in this respect the “Land of Promise” was something of a disappointment. Land monopolisation and speculation had set in and cut off the poor man’s access to nature’s storehouse.</p>
				<p>Other dreams were to be dissipated on reaching <span epub:type="z3998:place">India</span>. The best description of the passage and arrival there is found in a letter to his father and mother, dated <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span>, <time datetime="1855-12-12">December 12, 1855</time>.</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
					<p>“We hove up anchor in Hobson’s Bay about 11 o’clock on the <time datetime="1855-09-24">24th of September</time>, made sail, proceeded down the bay under charge of a pilot, and at about 5 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> passed the heads and discharged the pilot. After leaving <span epub:type="z3998:place">Port Philip</span> and until we had rounded <span epub:type="z3998:place">Cape Lewin</span> we had strong winds, mostly head, and cool weather. … Then the weather gradually became milder as we got to the northward, with fair, though not very strong winds. Near the line we had light airs, not even sufficient to fill the sails, but under the pressure of which the ship would go two or three miles per hour. We crossed the line <time datetime="1855-11-05">November 5</time>, when 42 days out. … From this place until we arrived at about 10° north we had the same fair airs as on the other side of the line, with every prospect of a short passage. Then the wind became stronger and more variable, but dead ahead. It would seldom blow from one point of the compass for more than an hour. Indeed, it seemed as if a second Jonah was aboard, for tack as often as we would, the wind was sure to head us off. … Progress under the circumstances was impossible. For over a week we did not gain a single inch to the northward. What she would make one hour she would lose the next. During this time the weather was delightful, warm without being uncomfortably so, and so pleasant that sleeping on deck could be practised with impunity.</p>
					<p>“At length on the morning of the <time datetime="1855-11-29">29th of November</time> the colour of the water suddenly changed to green, and by noon we were abreast of the lightship, which marks the outer pilot station. The tide was running so strongly that with the light air we could hardly hold our own against it. About 3 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr>, in obedience to a signal from the pilot brig, we cast anchor with 30 fathoms of chain, furled all sail, and cleared up decks for the night. At 8 <abbr class="time">p.m.</abbr> set anchor-watch and turned in for <em>all night</em> …”</p>

				<p>Then came the first impressions of the country⁠—impressions that always afterward remained vivid and helped before long to direct thought to social questions; that changed the fancied<span epub:type="z3998:place">India</span>⁠—the place of dreamy luxury, of soft and sensuous life⁠—into the real <span epub:type="z3998:place">India</span>, with its extremes of light and shadow, of poverty and riches, of degradation and splendour; where the few have so much, the many so little; where jewels blaze in the trappings of elephants, but where, as he has since said in talking with his son <span epub:type="z3998:given-name">Richard</span>, “the very carrion birds are more sacred than human life!” These impressions are preserved in a description of the trip to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span> up the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Hooghly</span> branch of the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Ganges River</span> scribbled in pencil on the back pages of one of the journal records.</p>

					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-12-03">Mon. Dec. 3.</time> We turned out about 3 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> and after some heavy heaving got up anchor. About 5 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> we were taken in tow by the steamer and proceeded up the river. The night air was misty and chilly and a monkey jacket proved very comfortable. The day soon began to break, revealing a beautiful scene. The river, at times very broad and again contracting its stream into a channel hardly large enough for a ship of average size to turn in, was bordered by small native villages, surrounded by large fruit trees, through which the little bamboo huts peeped. As we advanced, the mists which had hitherto hung over the river cleared away, affording a more extensive prospect. The water was covered with boats of all sizes, very queer looking to the eye of an <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">American</span>. They were most of them bound to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span> with the produce and rude manufactures of the country⁠—bricks, tiles, earths, pots, etc. They had low bows and very high sterns. They were pulled by from four to ten men, and steered by an old fellow wrapped up in a sort of cloth, seated on a high platform at the stern. Some had sails to help them along, in which there were more holes than threads. On the banks the natives began to go to their daily toil, some driving cattle along, others loading boats with grain, while the women seemed busy with their domestic affairs. As we approached the city, the banks on both sides were lined with handsome country residences of the wealthy English. About 10 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> we came to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Garden Reach</span>, where, as there was no Harbour Master’s Assistant ready to take us up, we were obliged to drop both anchors. After getting fairly moored we had a little time to look around us. The river which here takes a sudden bend, was crowded with ships of all nations, and above nothing could be seen but a forest of masts. On the right hand or <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span> side, are the <span epub:type="z3998:organization">East India Company</span>’s works, for repairing their steamers, numbers of which, principally iron, were undergoing repairs. On the other side was an immense palace-like structure (the residence, I believe, of some wealthy <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">Englishman</span>) surrounded by beautiful lawns and groves. The river was covered with boats and presented a bustling scene. One feature which is peculiar to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span> was the number of dead bodies floating down in all stages of decomposition, covered by crows who were actively engaged in picking them to pieces. The first one I saw filled me with horror and disgust, but like the natives, you soon cease to pay any attention to them.</p>
					<p epub:type="z3998:diary-entry">“<time datetime="1855-12-04">Tues. Dec. 4.</time> About 4:30 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> the Harbour Master came along side and we were roused up to get up anchors. … It astonished me to see with what ease the pilot took the vessel up … steering her amidst the maze of vessels as easily as if she was at sea. The port seemed crowded with vessels, a large proportion of them American, some of which I recognised as having seen at Philadelphia. At length about 10 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> we cast anchor off our intended moorings. About 2 <abbr class="time">a.m.</abbr> we hauled in and made fast along side of an <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">English</span> clipper, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">British Lion</i>. After getting all fast we had dinner and cleared up decks and squared the yards.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>While the ship lay at her moorings, visits were made to <span epub:type="z3998:place">Barrapore</span>, eighteen miles away, and other places of interest in the vicinity, and the boy saw those things that are observed generally by travellers. But the event of perhaps most interest to him was the receipt on <time datetime="1855-12-10">December 10</time> of letters from home⁠—the first since he had left. His father sent family news and said: “Your little brig is safely moored on the mantelpiece. First thing when we wake, our eyes rest upon her, and she reminds us of our dear sailor boy.”</p>
				<p>The mother’s letter also touched on family matters, but gave chief place to other things engaging her devout mind.</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
					<p>“And now for the news. The best news just now is the religious news⁠—a great work going on in <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:place">Philadelphia</span> and all the principal cities of the Union; prayer-meetings all over the land; all denominations uniting together in solemn, earnest prayer; Jayne’s Hall (you know its size) is crowded to excess, even those large galleries literally packed with men of the highest respectability⁠—merchants, bankers, brokers, all classes. Those who have never entered a church and have hitherto scoffed at religion meet at this prayer-meeting every day to hear the word of God road and solemn prayer offered for their conversion. … I might fill many pages to show you that this is truly the work of God⁠—the out-pouring of the Holy Spirit. … That same Holy Influence will be given to all that ask for it in simple faith: ‘Lord, teach me to pray.’ ”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The event to the lad next in interest to the receipt of home letters was the acquisition of a pet monkey, of which he wrote in later years:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>“I bought in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span>, when a boy, a monkey, which all the long way home would pillow her little head on mine as I slept, and keep off my face the cockroaches that infested the old Indiaman by catching them with her hands and cramming them into her maw. When I got her home, she was so jealous of a little brother that I had to part with her to a lady who had no children.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>In his account of the voyage, <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Captain</span> <span epub:type="z3998:family-name">Miller</span> says that the ship left <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span> with quite a menagerie of monkeys and birds aboard, but that before long “Harry’s was the only survivor.” The others died or got away, two of the sailors without intentional cruelty throwing theirs over board to see “which would swim ashore first,” but the animals quickly drowned. The boy cherished his little creature most fondly; though for that matter he always showed a warm love for animals, and this was but one of a great number that he had about him during his life.</p>
				<p>On the <time datetime="1856-01-15">15th of January, 1856</time>, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i> having completed her loading, consisting of nearly twelve hundred tons of rice, seeds, etc., took a new crew aboard and started down the river, homeward bound. <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Henry George</span> at the time estimated that he would have when he reached <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York</span> and settled his accounts “about fifty dollars to take clear of everything⁠—not much for thirteen or fourteen months.” The distance down the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Hooghly</span> from <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span> to the sea is eighty miles, but what with head winds, the scarcity of tow boats and a broken windlass, the vessel was twenty days making the passage, during which time the hot weather played havoc with the fresh provisions, so that the crew was the sooner reduced to “salt horse and biscuit.” Light winds blew down the bay of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Bengal</span> and the ship crossed the equator on the <time datetime="1856-01-23">23rd of February</time>. On the <time datetime="1856-01-27">27th</time> the cook, <span epub:type="se:name.person.full-name">Stephen Anderson</span>, fell sick and young George went into the galley temporarily. The journal says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary">

				</blockquote>
				<p>The cook having gone, the boy, to his great satisfaction, for he had an extreme distaste for the task, was superseded in the galley by one of the crew, who remained there for the rest of the voyage. The ship passed the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Cape of Good Hope</span> on <time datetime="1856-04-13">April 13</time> and within sight of <span epub:type="z3998:place"><abbr>St.</abbr> Helena</span> on the <time datetime="1856-04-27">27th</time>. On <time datetime="1856-05-12">May 12</time> she crossed the equator for the fourth time during the voyage. Long before that date the journal entries had become short, and after <time datetime="1856-05-06">May 6</time> stopped altogether, possibly because there was a great deal of work to do in handling, cleaning, repairing and painting the ship. <time>April</time> opened with this entry:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:diary">

				</blockquote>
				<p>And it was not long before he was home, for on <time datetime="1856-06-14">June 14</time>, after an absence of one year and sixty-five days, and from <span epub:type="z3998:place">Calcutta</span> one hundred and fifty days, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hindoo</i> completed her long journey and dropped anchor in <span epub:type="z3998:place">New York Bay</span>.</p>
